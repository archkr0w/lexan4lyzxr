*Replace two or more blanks in a row with a single blank and two or more tabs with a single tab.
*Delete comments that appear in a text file (single-line comments starting with the slashes are assumed to be single-line comments).
that begin with the # symbol.
*Print a text as it is in the input file, but every time it detects a ";" it prints the following text on a new line, and every time a √± appears in the text it is replaced by n.
*Also print the output text with the changes of the previous points and encrypt the text using the following substitution table:
